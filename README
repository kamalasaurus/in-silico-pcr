# in-silico-pcr

For a set of primers, we want to see if they match any regions in a large multi-fasta file for metagenomic analysis.

To do this we are:

1. Creating a Dockerfile that generates an image for isPCR from UCSC to run on the cluster.
2. Authoring a slurm script that can run this tool in an arrayed manner in an HPC environment.
3. Collecting other command line methods into commands.txt to regenerate the pipeline.

For the pipeline itself:

1. Create a tsv file of our primer pairs (primers.txt)
2. Create an index of our fasta file for fast access
3. We want to run our slurm script to match our primer pairs against our fasta.
4. We want to filter amplicons from 250-600 basepair matches.
